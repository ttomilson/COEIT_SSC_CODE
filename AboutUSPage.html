<h6> UMBC Shared Services Collective:</h6>
<p>
The UMBC Shared Services Collective is an initiative that has been in the works since 2017. The Shared Services Center (SSC) model’s goal is to consolidate expert resources in a centralized unit to increase service quality while allowing for projecting growth.  </p>


<h6>Shared Services Centers Across Campus:</h6>

<p>Departments across campus that have made the switch to this new model are the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Enrollment Management Services, Office of Center Administration and Managements, Student Affairs, and Division of Professional Studies. The College of Engineering and Information Technology (COEIT) launched our redesign in March of 2019.</p>


<h6>COEIT Shared Services Center:</h6>
<p> Before the SSC model, we had three separate Business Managers who oversaw specific departments in COEIT, in addition to the Division of Information Technology (DoIT). We now have three separate groups, the Business Operations Team (BOT), Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A), and the Sponsored Research Team (SRT), who specialize in their respective areas. We strive to provide seamless support to our faculty, staff, and students. Although each department is assigned to an individual team member as first point of contact, anyone on their respective team should be able to essentially pick up where another team member left off and, with minimal questions, keep the ball rolling.<br />

<a href="https://services-center.coeit.umbc.edu/business-operations/">Business Operations Team (BOT)</a>, led by Kathy Suess, is responsible for procurement and purchasing activities, in addition to on-boarding/Human Resources, and payroll.<br />

<a href="https://services-center.coeit.umbc.edu/financial-planning-analysis/">Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&A)</a> team, led by Lindita Dietzen, is responsible for departmental budgeting on a macro-level and financial analysis of allotted state funds.<br />

<a href="https://services-center.coeit.umbc.edu/sponsored-research/">Sponsored Research Team (SRT)</a>, led by Gina Fischer, is responsible for pre- and post-award activities and grant administration for principle investigators in the college.<br />
