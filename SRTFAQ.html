		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">We encourage you to submit the RT request as soon as you’ve made the decision to submit a proposal. We do not need all of the required documents at the time of the initial request. Submitting the request in advance will help us to distribute our workload.</li>
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">Since the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) requires that the proposal be fully routed through the Dean’s office three business days before the sponsor’s deadline, we need to have all required documents to review AT LEAST 5 business days before the sponsor’s deadline to perform minimum review before routing.</li>
			<li>Please reference our SRT Menu and document checklist for more specific information:</li>

		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">Per the <a href= "https://umbc.app.box.com/file/496740794697" target = "_blank" >memo</a> from the Office of Vice President of Research (OVPR), Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) requires that the proposal be fully routed through the Dean’s office 3 business days before the sponsor’s submission deadline.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><strong>What is a Letter of Intent/Concept Paper/White Paper/Pre-Proposal and does it need to be routed through Kuali?</strong></li>
		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;"> A Letter of Intent/Concept Paper/White Paper/Pre-Proposal is an informal proposal. Usually a brief document, they could range from 2-3 pages to as many as 10-20 pages depending on the requirements of a specific program.  They are used to explain the importance of a particular research project and may also be used to get invited to submit a full grant proposal. </li>
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">Some require only lump-sum cost estimates rather than detailed budgets. An informal proposal does not require campus endorsement; therefore, it does not need to proceed through the formal review and approval procedure. In those instances however, budgetary matters should be discussed with Business Managers and/or with the OSP to avoid confusion or misunderstanding at a later date. A lack of correlation between the technical proposal and the budget may lead to rejection of the proposal.  </li>
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">For those informal proposals that require a detailed budget and/or university approval, the informal proposal must be routed through OSP.</li>

	<li> <strong>Who in SRT can I expect to route a proposal for me? </strong></li>

	<li> <strong>Why do we need an NSF code if it's not an NSF Proposal? </strong></li>
		<ul style = "list-style-type: none; padding-top: 3px">
			<li style ="padding-bottom: 7px;">The NSF HERD survey is the primary source of information on research and development expenditures at higher education institutions in the United States and outlying areas. Over 900 universities and colleges complete the survey every year. UMBC’s participation in this survey is very important as it helps the NSF produce the most accurate statistics possible on U.S. higher education R&D expenditures.  </li>
