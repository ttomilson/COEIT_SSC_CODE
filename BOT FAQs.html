	<li><strong>When will I get access to Electronic Time Sheets (ETS)? </strong></li>
		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">Electronic time sheets (ETS) will populate for your new position within 2 to 3 pay cycles of when your paperwork is processed. You may not receive notifications when the time sheets are created, so you will need to log in to MyUMBC and click on Employee Time Sheets on the main page or check the link <a href = "https://my.umbc.edu/go/timesheets" target = "_blank">here</a> to see if your time sheets have begun populating every two weeks. </li></ul>
	<li><strong>How do I record my hours when I don’t have an ETS? </strong></li>
		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
			<li style = "list-style-type: none; padding-bottom: 7px;">Until the electronic time sheets begin populating, an employee will complete a paper time sheet every two weeks at the end of the pay period at this <a href = "https://www.umbc.edu/oit/timesheet/" target = "_blank">link</a>. The employee will fill out their name, hourly rate of pay, their supervisor, and choose the correct department and pay period from the dropdowns. They will then enter the hours worked on each appropriate day and then create "Generate Timesheet." The time sheet will then need to be signed and approved by both the employee and the supervisor and turned in to the Business Operations Team in ENG 202 for processing during the next available payroll processing period.</li>
			<li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">This process will need to be done separately for each pay period that requires it. These manual paper time sheets will not be accepted after electronic time sheets become available in order to prevent double submission of hours, so please check the ETS link every two weeks to see if they have become available. </li>

	<li><strong>I want to hire someone. When does the Business Operations Team need to be notified in order to have them on payroll by their start date? </strong></li>
		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
       <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">For salaried employees (Research or Instructional Faculty, Staff, Adjunct/PT Instructors, Graduate Assistants, Contingent II), the Business Operations Team needs to receive the request <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">at least 20 business days</span> before the employee’s requested start date. </li>
        <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">For hourly employees (students, Contingent I), the request needs to be received <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">at least 10 business days</span> before the requested start date. </li>
        <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">This lead-time for each category of employee gives the operations staff enough time to reach out to the employee, schedule needed appointments for new hires, and review and submit the paperwork by HR’s submissions deadlines. For specific hiring procedures, please refer to our Useful Files section on our <a href = "https://services-center.coeit.umbc.edu/business-operations/" target = "_blank">team page.</a></li>
    </ul>
	<li><strong>How do I keep a student on payroll after they graduate? </strong></li>
		<ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">After graduation, the student will be unable to continue working in their current graduate assistant or student hourly position. They will need to be placed into a contractual position (Contingent I) with the appropriate information completed on a contract and their resume. This type of request needs to be submitted to our office <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">at least 10 business days</span> before the contract’s requested start date to ensure it is processed under Human Resources payroll processing deadlines.</li>
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">Another option is to obtain a regular or contractual Faculty appointment, such as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate, which must be requested and approved by the requestor’s department, Dean’s Office, and the Provost’s Office. This process can take up to a month or more, so please plan accordingly if this is the path desired.  </li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>What are the best dates to use for a temporary contract?</strong></li>
    <ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">The best dates for a part-time contract will depend on the period of performance of the funding source and the length of time expected for the work to be completed. Our office needs to receive the request for this contract and all required documentation <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">at least 10 business days</span> before the contract’s requested start date.</li>
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">Preferred dates would fall on the beginning and end of a pay period. Temporary Contingent I contracts can be up to 6 months in length if they are 20 hours or more and can be renewed once, while If-and-When-Needed Contingent I contracts are for 19.75 hours and fewer and can be up to one year in length and be renewed continuously.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When will I receive my first paycheck? </strong></li>
    <ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">If the hiring paperwork is processed within HR’s submission deadlines, a salaried employee will receive their first paycheck the Friday following the end of the pay period in which their employment became active.</li>
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">For hourly employees, if the hiring paperwork and time sheets are submitted and processed in the appropriate time frame, they will receive their first pay check the third Friday from the end of the pay period in which their employment became active.  </li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>My paycheck didn’t reflect the number of hours I worked in my student/hourly position for last pay period. Could I get an explanation?</strong></li>
    <ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">All hourly positions are paid for hours worked during a pay period about three weeks after the end of that pay period. The process for each pay period is that the hours worked during that pay period are submitted and approved by the supervisor the week following the end of the pay period, reviewed and submitted to the State of Maryland for processing the following week, and then the check for those hours is cut the following Friday.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>When will my direct deposit go into effect?</strong></li>
    <ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">Generally, once the direct deposit form is mailed to the Central Payroll Bureau (CPB), it will be processed <span style = "text-decoration: underline;">within 2 to 3 pay cycles</span>. If it has not been processed within 6 weeks of when you submitted it and you are still receiving paper paychecks, please resubmit the direct deposit form or speak with one of the specialists in our office in ENG 202.  </li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>How can I see my paystubs? </strong></li>
    <ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">In order to access all of your paystubs, you will need to log in to the Payroll Online Service Center (POSC). Instructions for setting up an account are <a href = "https://hr.umbc.edu/files/2013/09/POSC-Set-up.pdf" target = "_blank">here.</a> If your direct deposit has been active for at least six pay cycles, you will need to contact the Business Operations Team to request a recent check advice number to set up your POSC account.</li>
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;"> If you are still receiving paper paychecks, the check advice number is located on your most recent paystub. Once an account is set up, you will be able to access a rolling 12 months of paycheck stubs and year-end paystubs outlining a summary of your earnings for the entire year for the past four years.  </li>

  <li><strong>When does a regular employee use Administrative Leave (ADM)?</strong></li>

    <ul style = "list-style-type:none; padding-top: 3px;">
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 7px;">In order to update your address or update your W-4, you will need to log in to the <a href = "https://interactive.marylandtaxes.gov/Extranet/cpb/POSC/User/Start.aspx" target = "_blank">POSC</a> and click on the link titled “Updated Address / W4 (Tax Withholding)” and complete the required information on the website with the new address or W-4 information. It will take about <span class = underlineText>10 business days</span> from the time of submission for the address or W-4 to be updated across all of the state’s databases for payroll.</li>
      <li style = "padding-bottom: 15px;">The only exemption from this process is if you claim Exempt for state and/or federal taxes on your W-4. If you claim Exempt, you will need to complete a paper W-4 with the new address or W-4 information and submit it to the HR department for processing.</li>
    </ul>
